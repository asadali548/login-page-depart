--------------------------------------------"Uber login page"-------------------------------------------

I have created documentation on  uber login page.
 In that login page differernt department like UI ,front end ,backend and database are working together
 
 > User Interface (UI):
 the UI is created to display the login information for the user ...
Form Elements: Text fields for entering phone number/email and password.
Buttons: “Log In” button to submit credentials and a “Forgot Password?” link for recovery.
Feedback Messages: Shows error messages for incorrect inputs and success messages upon successful login.
Looks : Clean and user-friendly design, maintaining Uber's brand colors and style.

> Front-End (Client-Side):
Input Validation: Front-end scripts validate user input to ensure that are  fields are not empty and format is correct.
Requests: then type 'password' and number / email is required to match with the credentials for this it request to back end and back end  match the input credentials with the stored data in the DataBase with out reloading the page.
Session Management: Stores session data  to keep the user logged in across the site.
Interactive : Enhances user experience with animations and transitions, handled by JavaScript or CSS.

> Back-End (Server-Side):
Authentication: Verifies user credentials against the database. If correct, it generates a session .
Error Handling: Provides meaningful error messages to the front-end if login fails (e.g., incorrect password).
Session Management: Handles the creation and validation of user sessions, ensuring secure access.

> Database:
User Data Storage: Stores user credentials and other related information in encrypted form for security.
Authentication Data: Manages data record like user IDs, passwords.
Activity Logging: Records login attempts and account-related activities for security .
